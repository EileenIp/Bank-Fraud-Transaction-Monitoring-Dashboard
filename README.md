# Bank-Fraud-Transaction-Monitoring-Dashboard
This project presents an end-to-end bank transaction monitoring dashboard designed to analyse transaction activity, detect potential fraud, and support operational oversight. The dashboard provides a clear view of transaction volume, success vs failure rates, fraud flags, network behaviour, and regional distribution.
